        1. Open source is the most awesome way of developing software ‚ù§Ô∏è
        2. If you are doing it for fun, ensure it stays fun!
            - And the moment it's not, it's okay to let go
        3. Giving back is not, and can never be, a condition for consuming open source, and maintainers have to come to terms with that
            - Whoever doesn't like it, should figure out a business model, do something else, or risk burning out!
        4. Great projects eventually require quality time, which in turn require either money, or personal sacrifice

        It was quite a ride. I learned a ton. I made new friends. I traveled around the world. And I gave back to the community.

        Not many people have the privilege to even devote time to creating open source. I feel truly fortunate of having done this.
